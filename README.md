### Save the world, one Sub at a time

Our mission is to help individuals around the world decrease their carbon footprint in their daily routine.

Over 13.7 billion metric tons of carbon emissions are emitted from food every year. Everyday, most of us consume food without a second thought, but now it’s time for change. Sub.it is a web application that can identify ingredients in your meals that have a large carbon footprint and substitute them with greener alternatives. With a click of a button, Sub.it can analyze images of food and suggest substitutions for ingredients that have a large carbon footprint.

Oftentime, individuals think about reducing their carbon footprint by making large investments like buying a Tesla. However, we built Sub.it in hopes of showing individuals they can also make smaller changes in their daily routine to make the same impact.

# Tensorflow Model
Our model analyzes pictures of foods to determine which ingredients can be substituted with ones that have a lower carbon footprint.
Since the model is too large for GitHub, it can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uT9nj5rxIW2kfQh4pNOZlkO0l6PXV6Vq/view?usp=sharing).
